## About this program

What you're about to see is a riff on the classic game Frogger using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The objective of this game is to reach the water at the very top of the screen. That is, if you can avoid the roided up bugs...

At the beginning of each play session the player character will be situated at the very bottom of the screen. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, find a way to traverse to the very top to escape this man made hell.

## Instructions

1. The player character can be moved using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys on your keyboard
2. A collision with any of the bugs will result in the player character returning back to the starting position
3. Your objective is to make your way to the pool of water at the very top of the screen
4. Upon completion, you'll have the opportunity to restart the game by clicking on the restart icon...If you dare

## Credits

* The collision functionality was taken from the following page: http://blog.sklambert.com/html5-canvas-game-2d-collision-detection/#d-collision-detection
* And finally... stackoverflow and its many contributors--where would we be without it?
